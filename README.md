A puzzle game which is sure to become a smash hit.

For any potential recruiters visiting looking for code samples, I have made my own pooling system:

[Assets/_scripts/Pooling](https://github.com/standingcode/word-slide/tree/5e1880ce87e993695ec8d64a589ea44098067d9f/Assets/_scripts/Pooling)

And have just finished this tile spawner:

[Assets/_scripts/TileManager.cs](https://github.com/standingcode/word-slide/blob/a4bd74f37443c081eccdbc82056897856b5f6f51/Assets/_scripts/TileManager.cs)

The project now requires the Zenject Unity package: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/extenject-dependency-injection-ioc-157735#content
